# Implementation-of-Decision-Tree-Regressor-Model-for-Predicting-the-Salary-of-the-Employee

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the Decision Tree Regressor Model for Predicting the Salary of the Employee.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Load the dataset and separate input feature (Level) and target variable (Salary).
2. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. Train a Decision Tree Regressor model using the training data.
4. Predict salary values and evaluate model performance using error metrics.
